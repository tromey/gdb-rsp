   Specifically, notifications may appear when GDB is not otherwise
reading input from the stub, or when GDB is expecting to read a normal
synchronous response or a '+'/'-' acknowledgment to a packet it has
sent.  Notification packets are distinct from any other communication
from the stub so there is no ambiguity.

--> uh oh


* maybe if start_packet is called again we should terminate the
  previous packet with an invalid checksum
  no.  we should buffer.

* handling the O packet properly

* 'cargo add --help' => "Could not add dependency.", ERROR blah blah
  maybe a bug in docopt?  or older version thereof?

x typo "dependant"

x description of z0 packet has a stray "see architecture-..."
  should mention this is in relation to KIND
  doesn't specify how KIND should be written

x can a Z1 packet have cmds?

x is there a way to probe for cond/cmd support in Z packets?
  [ConditionalBreakpoints]

x vcont "create" packet should document that R is ignored

x 'software' vs 'memory' breakpoint

x "W" and "X" stop reply packets accept longer hex values
  but documented as 2 digits

x stop reply packets dont really mention what to do in non-stop?
  just "OK" is sent

* `A' packet doesn't seem well-defined enough
  or implemented

* move all deprecated stuff to a new section

x docs say %%Stop:...
  but probably should be %Stop:...

* docs are also confused about notification packet in ACK mode
  well a bit, replies are normal packets apparently?

  there's no documentation about what ack you should send if you can't
  parse a notification
